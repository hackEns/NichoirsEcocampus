/*
    This code is for the bird houses sensing for Ecocampus.

    Circuit:
    ========
        * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
            ** MOSI - pin 11
            ** MISO - pin 12
            ** CLK - pin 13
            ** CS (== SS) - pin 10

        * Sensor attached to pin specified by sensor_pin.

    Usage:
    =======
        It will save timestamps at which the infrared beam was broke in a `data.csv` file on the SD card. The file is plaintext with one timestamp per line. As we do not have hardware clock, the timestamp is the number of seconds elapsed since the last reset of the ATmega.

        Debug is possible through Serial, if `debug` constant is set to `true`.


    Note:
    =====
        This code is in the public domain.
